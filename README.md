# VIDLY(Updated)

Vidly is a movie rental app that should allow its users add movies and rent them to various clients.
**NOTE: The frontend has been developed with ReactJS while the backend has been developed with Node, ExpressJS, and MongoDB**

The app was designed by Mosh Hamedani @ https://codewithmosh.com. He used it for his React and Node course tutorial videos.
I took these courses and when I came back I realized that there were a lot of outdated packages leading to various deprecation warnings and breaking chances. This commit has been implemented solely to address these various breaking changes and warnings and to provide a valid reference for others.

## IMPROVEMENTS MADE

- App dependencies have been updated, breaking changes have been corrected.
- App can be accessed via docker (@https://hub.docker.com/u/dansatch)
